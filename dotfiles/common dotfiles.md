## Common dotfiles

On Linux and macOS there are certain dotfiles that you will commonly see:

Dotfile | Description
--------| -----------
~/.bash_profile | A script loaded when you log in
~/.bashrc | A script loaded when you open a terminal
~/.emacs.d | Emacs configuration
~/.vimrc | Vim configuration
~/.gitconfig | Git configuration
~/.config | A folder full of many more configuration files

Dotfiles aren't as common on Windows, but many cross-platform programs will store dot-configuration files in `C:/Users/username` or `C:/Users/username/AppData/Roaming`.
